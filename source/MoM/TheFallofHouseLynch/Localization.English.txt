""Time is money, and we're losing it by the truckload.""\n\n""I need your help finding our missing business parter.""\nHe tosses you a dirty manila folder.  ""Our missing man is named Walter Lynch.

The doctors were mystified as it slowly consumed his flesh.  I am a man of action and could not sit around and wait for my heir to deteriorate.\nNine months I spent traveling the globe. Searching for a cure. From the depths of the jungles to the wisdom of the orient, I found nothing. I kept searching, deeper and deeper into the lost places of the world and beyond. I witnessed many mysteries and horrors, but the cure still eluded me.\n\nLittle did I know that it was already too late.  Back home, my son passed from this world with no father there to comfort him.\n\nI returned home to my wife Edith, intending to stay for good.  We grieved.  Life slowly returned to normal and I returned to work.  I started up new business ventures and grew my fortune while my soul languished.\n\nThe healing process was not easy, but I found that helping mend Edith's heart helped me ignore my own pain."""
